# Simple-Sales-Validation-Form
Very simple form for help sales people validate leads. 

This form while really simple does a few things. 

1. It takes an uploaded document and attaches it an email
2. Take the answers and attaches it as a text file to the email

While that in itself is simple, the form was quite long and the company I wrote it for is very happy with it. They are getting a 
ton of leads that their salespeople now can have a one sheet document when they get on the call. 

It serves it's purpose, and since I wrote it and someone else might need one, here ya go!
